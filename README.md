## 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A comprehensive movie recommendation system that combines **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering** approaches to provide personalized movie recommendations. Built with Python, Streamlit, and powered by TMDb API.

---

## 🌟 Features

* **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations
* **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit-based UI with movie posters and descriptions
* **Real-time Movie Data**: Fetches movie information and posters from TMDb API
* **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords
* **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages user ratings using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* **Smart Similarity Scoring**: Cosine similarity for content-based recommendations

## 🧠 Implemented Approaches

### ✅ Content-Based Recommendation

We have implemented a **Content-Based Recommendation System**, where recommendations are generated based on the similarity between movies. For each movie, we combine multiple features such as **genres**, **overview**, **keywords**, **cast**, and **crew**, and use **CountVectorizer** to convert the textual data into numerical vectors. These vectors are then compared using **cosine similarity** to suggest movies that are most similar in terms of content. This method does not require any user data and purely depends on the movie metadata.

### ✅ Hybrid Recommendation

In addition to content-based filtering, we have also implemented a **Hybrid Recommendation System** that combines both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** methods. Collaborative filtering is powered by **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** on user ratings. The final recommendations are computed using a **weighted average** of both similarity scores — allowing the system to balance between what the user might like (collaborative) and what is similar to a selected movie (content-based). The hybrid approach is more robust and provides better personalized recommendations.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Sources

* **TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset**: Contains movie metadata (title, overview, genres, keywords)
* **TMDb 5000 Credits Dataset**: Contains cast and crew information
* **MovieLens Links**: Maps MovieLens IDs to TMDb IDs for rating data

### Model Architecture

#### Content-Based Filtering

* **Feature Extraction**: Combines movie overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew
* **Vectorization**: Uses CountVectorizer with 5000 features
* **Similarity**: Cosine similarity between movie vectors

#### Collaborative Filtering

* **Matrix Factorization**: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with 50 components
* **Rating Prediction**: Predicts user ratings for unseen movies
* **Scalability**: Handles sparse rating matrices efficiently

#### Hybrid Approach

* **Combination**: Weighted average of content-based and collaborative scores
* **Parameter**: α (alpha) controls the balance between approaches
* **Default**: α = 0.5 (equal weighting)

---

### API Integration

* **TMDb API**: Fetches movie posters and descriptions in real-time
* **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanism for API failures
* **Caching**: Efficient session management for API requests

---

## 📊 Model Performance

The system provides recommendations based on:

* **Content Similarity**: Movies with similar genres, cast, and themes
* **User Preferences**: Patterns from similar users' rating behavior
* **Hybrid Scoring**: Balanced approach combining both methods

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Model Training

The models are trained using the `hybrid.ipynb` notebook, which includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and merging datasets
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating movie tags from multiple sources
3. **Model Training**: Training both content-based and collaborative models
4. **Model Persistence**: Saving trained models for deployment

### Key Functions

* `recommend(movie_title)`: Returns top 5 movie recommendations
* `fetch_movie_data(movie_id)`: Retrieves movie data from TMDb API
* `hybrid_recommend(user_id, movie_title, α=0.5)`: Hybrid recommendation function

---

## 🔒 API Configuration

The application uses a TMDb API key for fetching movie data. The current key is included in the code, but for production use, consider:

* Using environment variables for API keys
* Implementing rate limiting
* Adding API key rotation

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* **User Authentication**: Personal recommendation history
* **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by genre, year, rating
* **A/B Testing**: Compare different recommendation algorithms
* **Real-time Learning**: Update models with new user interactions
* **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
